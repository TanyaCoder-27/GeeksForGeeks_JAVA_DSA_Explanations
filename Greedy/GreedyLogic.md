Characteristics of Greedy Problems
Greedy Choice Property:

You can make an optimal choice at each step, and that local optimal choice leads to the global optimal solution.

Example: In the Activity Selection Problem, selecting the activity that ends the earliest ensures you can fit the maximum number of activities.

Optimal Substructure:

A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

Example: In the Fractional Knapsack Problem, you can divide items into fractions and maximize profit step by step.

Tips to Identify When to Use Greedy
Ask These Questions:

Can I solve this problem by making a series of decisions one at a time?

Does solving smaller parts of the problem guarantee a solution for the whole?

Simple Proof Test:

Try proving that making the locally optimal choice won’t mess up the global solution. If you can prove this (or intuitively sense it), Greedy may work.

When Not to Use Greedy
If the problem requires exploring multiple options and “backtracking” to try different combinations, Greedy won't work.

Example: Dynamic Programming is better for problems where subproblems overlap and require considering many possible solutions (like Longest Common Subsequence or Matrix Chain Multiplication).

Key Examples of Greedy
Here are some classic problems to keep in mind as you practice:

Activity Selection Problem

Fractional Knapsack

Huffman Encoding

Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s/Kruskal’s)

Job Sequencing Problem

Greedy is like a tool in your problem-solving toolbox—once you recognize its patterns and limitations, you’ll know exactly when to pull it out!
